# Job Hunter (Client)

This project serves as the client of my job hunter app (MERN),
which saves job postings submitted by user to MongoDB. It was
created by CRA (create-react-app), and newer version of the
client has been migrated to Vite in [another Git repository](https://github.com/alexhyang/jobhunter-React-Vite).
